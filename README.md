# Project Overview
Maria, the chief data scientist in the city school district, needs to analyze multiple forms of data across a school district to gain insight on school performance based on student funding and standardized test scores. This project's purpose is to aggregate data and showcase trends in school performance. 

# Challenge
The school district discovered the standardized test scores for the ninth graders at Thomas High School had been altered. Thus, we need to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High SChool with NaNs while making sure the rest of the data is not changed.
